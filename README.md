OpenAI currently offers the `gpt-4-vision-preview` model access via the API, but there is no user-friendly UI to interact with it. An alternative is paying for $20/Month for "ChatGPT Plus". If you don't use GPT-Vision a lot, it's cheaper accessing it via the API.

To try it yourself you can build the Dockerfile and run it. It will open a webserver with the port 3001. You will need an OpenAI API-Key to use it.
